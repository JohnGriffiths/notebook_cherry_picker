# ipynb-workdocs branch of notebook_cherry_picker

(for explanation of how notebook_cherry_picker works, see the 'master' branch in either this fork or jdfreder's original repo)

This ipynb-workdocs branch of my notebook_cherry_picker fork adds some files and some modifications to work with my ipynb-workdocs repo. Not quite enough modifications to warrant reproducing/stealing the code wholesale, so I'm including this branch as a submodule in ipynb-workdocs. 

See the [ipynb-workdocs repo](https://github.com/JohnGriffiths/ipynb-workdocs) for documentation and explanation on what this is all for.
